# Player

This project is a music player similar to Spotify, with the album "O menino que queria ser Deus", by the Brazilian artist Djonga.


## Appendix

The application is very intuitive and easy to use. As soon as the application is opened, the Start button will appear on the initial screen, which will start the music player, and when you click on the forward button, the player will change to the next song.
